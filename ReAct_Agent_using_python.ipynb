However, widespread commercial use of flying cars is still in the developmental stage, facing challenges such as safety regulations, air traffic management, and infrastructure requirements.\\n\\nIn summary, while flying cars are a concept that is being explored, they are not yet a common reality.'"

I previously talked with Natasha two years ago about Microsoft Bing.\n",

It did such a good job that I'm including it here \n",
