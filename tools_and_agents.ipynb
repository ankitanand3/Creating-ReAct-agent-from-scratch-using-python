      "Page: LangChain\n",
      "Summary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Vector database\n",
      "Summary: A vector database, vector store or vector search engine is a database that stores and retrieves embeddings of data in vector space. Vector databases typically implement approximate nearest neighbor algorithms so users can search for records semantically similar to a given input, unlike traditional databases which primarily look up records by exact match. Use-cases for vector databases include similarity search, semantic search, multi-modal search, recommendations engines, object detection, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
      "Vector embeddings are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, with the number of dimensions ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands, depending on the complexity of the data being represented. Each data item is represented by one vector in this space. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized.\n",
      "These feature vectors may be computed from the raw data using machine learning methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings or deep learning networks. The goal is that semantically similar data items receive feature vectors close to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information from external data sources. With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don't exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.\n",
      "RAG also reduces the need to retrain LLMs with new data, saving on computational and financial costs. Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include sources in their responses, so users can verify the cited sources. This provides greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "The term RAG was first introduced in a 2020 research paper.\n"

It is built on the concept of assistants, which are agents configured for specific tasks, and includes built-in persistence and a task queue. This versatile API supports a wide range of agentic application use cases, from background processing to real-time interactions.\\nUse Agent Server to create and manage assistants, threads, runs, cron jobs, webhooks, and more.\\nAPI reference\\nFor detailed information on the API endpoints and data models, refer to the API reference docs.\\nTo use the Enterprise version of the Agent Server, you must acquire a license key that you will need to specify when running the Docker image.

       "  AIMessage(content=\"Langgraph Studio is a platform designed for deploying and managing applications that utilize graphs, particularly in the context of creating intelligent assistants. Here’s a brief overview of its key components and how to use it:\\n\\n### Key Components of Langgraph Studio\\n\\n1. **Graphs**: \\n   - A graph serves as a blueprint for an Assistant. You can deploy multiple assistants from a single graph, each with unique configurations to cater to different use cases.\\n\\n2. **Agent Server**: \\n   - This is the core component where you deploy your graphs. It manages the deployment of one or more graphs, a database for data persistence, and a task queue.\\n\\n3. **Persistence and Task Queue**: \\n   - Langgraph Studio uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for managing tasks. If you use LangSmith cloud, these components are managed for you; otherwise, you need to set them up on your infrastructure.\\n\\n4. **Application Structure**: \\n   - You need to structure your application correctly for deployment, which includes specifying the graphs and relevant configuration settings.\\n\\n### How to Use Langgraph Studio\\n\\n1. **Set Up Your Environment**: \\n   - Ensure you have the necessary components like PostgreSQL and Redis if you're not using the cloud service.\\n\\n2. **Define Your Graphs**: \\n   - Create the graphs that will serve as the foundation for your assistants. Each graph can implement various functionalities, from simple chatbots to complex applications.\\n\\n3. **Deploy Your Application**: \\n   - Use the Agent Server to deploy your graphs. During deployment, a default assistant is created for each graph based on its configuration.\\n\\n4. **Manage and Scale**: \\n   - Monitor and manage your deployments, and scale your application as needed. You can also implement CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.\\n\\n5. **Utilize Documentation**: \\n   - Refer to the [Langgraph documentation](https://docs.langchain.com) for detailed guides on application structure, deployment components, and API references.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use Langgraph Studio to create and manage intelligent applications based on graph structures.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 429, 'prompt_tokens': 1918, 'total_tokens': 2347, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1152}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c4585b5b9c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CuOlMNRj5nbhCRNTLX6yw4fEczcqS', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b8aa4-73c7-7811-aad3-0601a6fc5c57-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1918, 'output_tokens': 429, 'total_tokens': 2347, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1152}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}"
